# ApacheTest
A test for my local server using Apache2.

I was in the NJIT RWC program over the summer from June 22nd through July 23rd.

The coach in my track Ja582 (github) helped me to setup a local server.

He also gave me a brief introduction to SQLite and how to make a Command Line Only Ubuntu Virtual Machine using VirtualBox on Ubuntu.
